## Overview
Mad Mannequins is a sizeable part mod that adds a considerable number of human-anatomy-themed parts, which are used to build the namesake Mannequins. At present, the mod contains a total of 214 parts in total.

## Features
The mod features 4 distinct mannequins, from which the individual parts have been harvested. All pats are stackable without the need of the Stacker mod. These include:

1. A traditional wooden-style drawing mannequin. Androgynous, which is to say ambiguously-gendered, the mannequin is simple, subdivided into the major body parts, perfect for creating low-rendering-cost figures.
2. A Female human mannequin, designed in line with average-ideal body proportions for the given age range in mind. This mannequin requires considerably more resources to paint, but has been designed in such a way as to optimise the painted textures. 
3. A Male human mannequin, designed in line with average-ideal body proportions for the given age range in mind. This mannequin requires considerably more resources to paint, but has been designed in such a way as to optimise the painted textures. 
4. A largely accurate human Skeleton, divided into several major bone groups. As with the previous two mannequins, coloured bones require considerably more resources to paint. 
5. A largely accurate Paint horse, with several smaller parts making up the head, though lacking a tail.

This mod is still in development, and will receive irregular, but large updates. When making suggestions, please note that the theme of this mod is realistic anatomy, and suggestions that do not fit that theme will likely be ignored. There are also likely to be some bugs to fix, so please make certain to give detailed accounts and report of them.

This mod must be installed via the Spore ModAPI Easy Installer, available as part of the Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit, available here: http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/.
